##How do I build a simple website that just shows content, but doesn't have things like user interaction?

This kind of website is useful for a personal portfolio that contains links to stuff you've done, or to just display stuff to people. This allows you to tell people to go to a URL to see your website, but those people can't register for an account, leave comments, or interact with each other.

This kind of website consists of a couple different parts: the html and css you see, the host you upload those files to, and a registered domain that lets other people go to a URL to see your files.

###Learn HTML

The most basic building block of a website is HTML. HTML isn't really a programming language because it doesn't really "do" anything, but it does allow you to tell a browser what to display. For example, this is a snippet of html:

    <ul>
    	<li>Thing One</li>
    	<li>Thing Two</li>
    	<li>Thing Three</li>
    </ul>
    
This html tells the browser to display something that looks like this:

  - Thing One
  - Thing Two
  - Thing Three

You write HTML in the same way that you write a term paper or an assignment: using some kind of text editor. You can write HTML in a basic text editor (I'm writing this in JEdit), or you can download text editors specifically designed to help you write HTML. If you're just starting out, I recommend using a basic text editor like Notepad or JEdit.

Once you've written an HTML document, you simply save it as a .html file. Then you can open that file up in a web browser exactly like you open up any other web page.

[W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) is an excellent place to start learning HTML.
    
###Learn CSS

Once you start writing HTML, you'll realize that your pages don't look very exciting. That's because HTML tells the browser **what** to display, but you need CSS to tell the browser **how** to display it.

Things like sizes, colors, background images, placement of different sections, etc are all defined by CSS.

Like HTML, you can write CSS in a basic text editor.

Again, [W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) is the best place to start learning CSS.

###Get a Domain Name

The best way to learn HTML and CSS is to write HTML and CSS using a basic text editor, then save the files to your own computer, and then open them up in a web browser.

But you probably want other people to be able to see your website, and for that you need two things: a domain name and a host.

A domain name is just your own website URL- StaticVoidGames.com is my domain name.

To get your own domain name, you have to use a **domain name registrar** which is just a company that registers your domain name for you. Registering your domain name is as simple as filling out a form and entering your credit card info.

This can be pretty cheap- just a couple dollars per year, or it can be much more expensive if you want to buy a popular domain name. I think I pay something like 10 dollars a year for StaticVoidGames.com.

GoDaddy is an example of a domain name registrar, and it's what I use, but there are other options out there. Use google to do some research to figure out what's best for you.

###Get a Host

Once you have a domain name set up, the next thing you'll need to do is find a **host**, which is just a place you upload your HTML and CSS files, as well as any images or other files you use on your website.

Some domain registrars offer hosting as well, but you don't have to use the same company for both. For example, I use GoDaddy to register my domain, but I use HostGator to host basic HTML files. Again, this might not be the **best** services around, so do some research! Googling "webhost services" will get you a ton of results.

You can then point your registered domain to your host (the service you use to register your domain and your host will include directions on how to do that), then upload your files to your host, and now anybody who goes to your domain will see your html files!

###Or Don't

All of the above assumes that you want to create your own website- but this might not be true for everybody. There are plenty of existing sites that let you upload specialized content (Etsy allows you to sell stuff, SmugMug allows you to upload and sell photographs, and StaticVoidGames allows you to upload games), all without knowing any html or worrying about finding a host or registering a domain.

If you don't want to create your own website, then you should consider using an existing service so you just worry about your content. But if you do want to create your own website from scratch, the above steps are a good place to start.
