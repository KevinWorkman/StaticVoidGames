The central goal of Static Void Games is to help promote indie developers and encourage indie game development. Letting indie developers know their rights is an important part of that goal.

Therefore, this page serves as an agreement between this site, developers, and our users. It is meant to clear up any confusion about open source, copyright, your rights as a developer, and what you can and cannot do with the games and source here.

###What are my rights as a developer?

You automatically own the copyright to any game you create. You don't have to file any official forms. You create it, it's yours. Simple. Even if you post the source to your game, the game, and the source, still belong to you. It's always up to you what people are allowed to do with that source.

###What are my rights as a player?

You can feel free to download and learn from the source that other people post, but do not simply copy the code and claim it as your own. If you do, your game can be removed and your account may be blocked. Individual games can have individual copyright licenses, so consult the specific game's page (or contact the developer) to be sure.

###What are the rights of Static Void Games?

When you upload your game, you are giving the general public the right to play your game in whatever form you submit it. You are giving Static Void Games the right to advertise your game using your game art. If you include code, you are giving the general public the right to look at that code for educational purposes. Anything else is up to you and can be specified in the game description.

###Do I have to release the source for my games?

Nope. You are encouraged to make the source available so other people can learn from your game, but feel free to leave the source field blank when uploading a game.

###If I do release the source, what can other people do with it?
That's completely up to you. You can specify what people can do with your source by including it in your game's description or by choosing an open source license. Please note that open source does NOT necessarily mean that anybody can do whatever they want with your source or game- you are the only one who can decide that.

###What about my game art or sounds?

Same deal. You can specify what people can do with your art. Without your express permission, people cannot use something you created. However, Static Void Games does reserve the right to use your game art, including screenshots of your game, for promotional purposes- this means that we're allowed to use your game's thumbnail to make links to your game prettier, and we're allowed to do things like write a blog post showcasing your game.

###What if I see somebody infringing on my copyright?

First off, contact that person. Chances are s/he didn't know they were violating your copyright. If that doesn't work, contact me and I'll look into it for you.
